### Setup
GNvpro is a subdirectory of Meganet.m repository. Download or clone from below:

[https://github.com/XtractOpen/Meganet.m](https://github.com/XtractOpen/Meganet.m)

Before running the scripts, set the Matlab path to include all of the Meganet.m repository.  Change the working directory to Meganet.m and run the following command:

```matlab
addpath(genpath('.'))
```

The scripts used in the paper are located in the subdirectory **examples/GNvpro** and are listed below.  The scripts include the hyperparameters used in the paper as well as code to visualize the results. 

###Toy Example

Train a DNN on a binary classification problem determining if points are contained inside an ellipse or not.

```matlab
EVP_Circle_GNvpro.m
EVP_Circle_GN.m
```

### PDE Surrogate Modeling

Train a DNN as a surrogate model of a PDE.  The data is available for download [here](url).

#### Convection Diffusion Reaction (CDR)


```matlab
EVP_CDR_GNvpro.m
EVP_CDR_GN.m
EVP_CDR_SGD.m
EVP_CDR_LBFGSvpro.m
```

#### Direct Current Resistivity (DCR)

```matlab
EVP_DCR_GNvpro.m
EVP_DCR_GN.m
EVP_DCR_SGD.m
EVP_DCR_LBFGSvpro.m
```

We generated the data in Matlab using a Finite Volume approach.  The code used to generate the data is available in the subdirectory **data/DCR**.

```matlab
driverGenerateDCRData.m % script to generate DCR data
setupDCROperators.m 		% function to setup finite volume operators
solveDCR.m 							% function to solve the PDE
```

### Classification and Image Segmentation

#### Indian Pines
Train a DNN to segment the [Indian Pines dataset](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes).  The data consists of 145 x 145 images corresponding to 220 spectral wavelengths.  The goal is to classify the material or crop located at each pixel.

EVP_IndianPines_GN.m
EVP_IndianPines_SGD.m
EVP_IndianPines_LBFGSvpro.m
